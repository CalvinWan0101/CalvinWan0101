# Hi, This is Xiang-Rui, Wan
You can call me `Calvin` or `Xiang-Rui`.

### About me

I am a junior at Taipei Tech majoring in computer science. I am interested in backend development, software design, and software testing. So far, I've learned about test-driven design, refactoring, and several design patterns. Currently, I am learning about Clean Code and Clean Architecture. I enjoy applying what I've learned to my development projects.
